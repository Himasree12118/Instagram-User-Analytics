Implemented my understanding of a dataset with the users' engagement on the Instagram app.

Analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app
SQL Tasks :
A) Marketing Analysis:
Loyal User Reward: Identify the five oldest users on Instagram from the provided database.
Inactive User Engagement: Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
Contest Winner Declaration: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.
Hashtag Research: Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
Ad Campaign Launch: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.

B) Investor Metrics:
User Engagement: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
Bots & Fake Accounts: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.
